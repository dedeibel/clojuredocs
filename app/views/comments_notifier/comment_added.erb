Hi,

We thought you'd like to know that <%= @comment.user.login %> just added a comment to <%= @comment.function.namespace.name %>/<%= @comment.function.name %>: http://clojuredocs.org/docstring_comments/view/<%= @comment.function.id %>#docstring_comment_<%= @comment.id %>

<%= @comment.body %>

You've been sent this email because you had previously commented on this var.

To unsubscribe to comments on this specific var visit http://clojuredocs.org/docstring_comments/view/<%= @comment.function.id %>#notify_me and uncheck 'Send me an email when somebody adds / updates a comment'.

Thanks, ClojureDocs.
